## Background

Renewable solar photovoltaic energy generation has been widely utilized to support electricity supply nowadays. The rapid change of solar photovoltaic energy generation causes challenges to manage the solar photovoltaic energy generation systems. Estimating and forecasting solar irradiance can be referenced to understand performance of renewable solar photovoltaic energy generation in advance and resolve some of the challenges to manage the system.

## Algorithm Description

As a method to estimate solar irradiance, we utilized cloud cover estimation using a machine learning model called U-Net [1]. The application estimates solar irradiance from a calculated cloud cover ratio and outputs the percentage of solar irradiance in Watt per square meter.
