# Background
Renewable solar photovoltaic energy generation has been widely utilized to support electricity supply nowadays. The rapid change of solar photovoltaic energy generation causes challenges to manage the solar photovoltaic energy generation systems. Estimating and forecasting solar irradiance can be referenced to understand performance of renewable solar photovoltaic energy generation in advance and resolve some of the challenges to manage the system.

# Algorithm Description
As a method to estimate solar irradiance, we utilized cloud cover estimation using a machine learning model called U-Net [1]. The application estimates solar irradiance from a calculated cloud cover ratio and outputs the percentage of solar irradiance in Watt per square meter.

# Using the code
Output: solar irradiance (W/m2)  
Input: cloud cover ratio (0-1)  
Image resolution: N/A  
Inference (calculation) time:  
Model loading time: N/A  

# Arguments
   '-debug': Debug flag  
   '-node-latitude': Latitude of the node location (default = 36.691959)  
   '-node-longitude': Longitude of the node location (default = -97.565965)  

# Ontology:
The code publishes measurements with toptic ‘env.solar.irradiance’

# Inference from Sage codes
To query the output from the plugin, you can do with python library 'sage_data_client':
```
import sage_data_client

# query and load data into pandas data frame
df = sage_data_client.query(
    start="-1h",
    filter={
        "name": "env.solar.irradiance",
    }
)

# print results in data frame
print(df)
```
